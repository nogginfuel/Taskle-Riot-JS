Learning Riot JS via ToDo

I thought the best place to start learning [Riot JS] was through the traditional ToDo app.

I wanted to add a bit more style to the basic app while studying its functionality.
I decided to integrate several aspects of Material Design via ideas in [Materialize][2].

*Roadmap:*
Potentially integrate the timer example with the todo app.
Add more design elements and ideas from Materialize.

Thanks to these people for making my learning possible:
